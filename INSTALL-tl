Installing TransLucid on a Linux or Unix machine

===================================================================

Prerequisites

Installing TransLucid may take a while, because of prerequisites,
listed below.  Depending on the state of your system, you may not
need to build all of these.  For the purposes of discussion, we
assume that the version numbers referred to in the instructions
below are the ones we are using.

- GCC 4.7.0 or higher, we are using 4.7.0.
- ICU 4.6 or higher, we are using 49_1.
- BOOST 1_46_0 or higher, we are using 1_49_0.
- TransLucid, latest version, currently 0.2.0.

===================================================================

Summary

This is the full build sequence.  If you already have some of these
prerequisites, then you will not need to build everything.

- Set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables.
- Ensure GCC is installed.
- Ensure ICU is installed.
- Ensure BOOST is installed.
- Download TransLucid.
- Install TransLucid.

===================================================================

Detailed Instructions

TransLucid needs to be compiled with a C++ compiler which supports
C++11, the new C++ standard.  We use GCC version 4.7.0, which
provides a partial implementation of this standard.

The compilation and running of TransLucid also uses a number of
the BOOST libraries.  You will probably need to install a recent
version of BOOST on your system; before this can be done, you will
need to ensure you have recent versions of ICU and MPI.

Given that there are many packages to install, we recommend
creating a directory called "soft".  Under this directory, there
should be a "downloads" subdirectory to store the downloads, a
"src" subdirectory to do the compilations, and an "install"
subdirectory to place the generated binaries, header files and
libraries.  The instructions given below assume this setup, which
will make it easier to maintain, clean, remove, update and find
the installed packages.  All sequences of instructions assume that
you are starting in the soft directory.

If you follow this advice, then all of the installation directories
specified after --prefix in the instructions given below will be
this "install" directory.  This directory will also need to be
added to the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.

Specifically, in the instructions below:

- $SOFT is the full path of the soft directory.
- $SRC is the $SOFT/src directory.
- $DOWNLOADS is the $SOFT/downloads directory.
- $PREFIX is the $SOFT/install directory.

TransLucid from Tarball

TransLucid's source code is hosted on sourceforge.net and released as
a tarball. The latest release is version 0.2.0.
To get the source, type:

    cd $SRC
    wget \
http://sourceforge.net/projects/translucid/files/TransLucid/0.2.0/tl-0.2.0.tar.bz2/download \
    -O tl-0.2.0.tar.bz2

or direct your browser to the above URL. This downloads the 
distribution tarball as tl-0.2.0.tar.bz2. To untar it, type:

    tar -xf tl-0.2.0.tar.bz2

This creates a new directory, tl-0.2.0, and unpacks the
source there.  (Note that if you already downloaded TransLucid
from sourceforge yourself, you would know this first step, as
you did it already!)

To build TransLucid:

    cd $SRC
    cd tl-0.2.0
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-static
    make
    make install

The --disable-static flag will make TransLucid compile faster.

Possibly, you will need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to find
the icu-uc package.

TransLucid from Git

TransLucid's source code is hosted on sourceforge.net in a git repository.
To get the source:

    cd $SRC
    git clone \
        git://translucid.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/translucid/translucid \
        translucid-git

This creates a new directory, translucid-git, and clones the
source there.  (Note that if you already downloaded TransLucid
from sourceforge yourself, you would know this first step, as
you did it already!)

To build TransLucid:

    cd $SRC
    cd translucid-git
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" --disable-static
    make
    make install

The --disable-static flag will make TransLucid compile faster.

Possibly, you will need to set the PKG_CONFIG_PATH variable to find
the icu-uc package.
