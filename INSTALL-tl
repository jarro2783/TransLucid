Installing TransLucid on a Linux or Unix machine

===================================================================

Prerequisites

Installing TransLucid may take a while, because of prerequisites,
listed below.  Depending on the state of your system, you may not
need to build all of these.  For the purposes of discussion, we
assume that the version numbers referred to in the instructions
below are the ones we are using.

- GMP 4.3.2 or higher, we are using 5.0.2.
- MPFR 2.4.2 or higher, we are using 3.0.1.
- MPC 0.8.1 or higher, we are using 0.9.
- GCC 4.7.0 or higher, we are using 4.7.0.
- ICU 3 or higher, we are using 4_8_1.
- MPI 1.0.x or higher, we are using 1.5.4.
- BOOST 1_46_0 or higher, we are using 1_48_0.
- TransLucid, latest version.

===================================================================

Summary

This is the full build sequence.  If you already have some of these
prerequisites, then you will not need to build everything.

- Install, in this order, GMP, MPFR and MPC. 
- Set PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables.
- Install GCC.
- Ensure ICU and MPI are installed.
- Download TransLucid.
- Install BOOST.
- Install TransLucid.

===================================================================

Detailed Instructions

TransLucid needs to be compiled with a C++ compiler which supports
C++11, the new C++ standard.  We use GCC version 4.7.0, which
provides a partial implementation of this standard.  Since this
version of GCC is still experimental, you will need to install
it explicitly on your system; before this can be done, you will
need to compile updated versions of GMP, MPFR and MPC.

The compilation and running of TransLucid also uses a number of
the BOOST libraries.  You will probably need to install a recent
version of BOOST on your system; before this can be done, you will
need to ensure you have recent versions of ICU and MPI.

Given that there are many packages to install, we recommend
creating a directory called "soft".  Under this directory, there
should be a "downloads" subdirectory to store the downloads, a
"src" subdirectory to do the compilations, and an "install"
subdirectory to place the generated binaries, header files and
libraries.  The instructions given below assume this setup, which
will make it easier to maintain, clean, remove, update and find
the installed packages.  All sequences of instructions assume that
you are starting in the soft directory.

If you follow this advice, then all of the installation directories
specified after --prefix in the instructions given below will be
this "install" directory.  This directory will also need to be
added to the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables.

Specifically, in the instructions below:

- $SOFT is the full path of the soft directory.
- $SRC is the $SOFT/src directory.
- $DOWNLOADS is the $SOFT/downloads directory.
- $PREFIX is the $SOFT/install directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

GMP

GMP, or the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, can be
downloaded from

    http://gmplib.org/

as a distribution tarball ($DOWNLOADS/gmp-5.0.2.tar.bz2).  For
detailed installation instructions, read the INSTALL file in the
root directory of the source. Here is the short version:

    cd $SRC
    tar xjf $DOWNLOADS/gmp-5.0.2.tar.bz2
    cd gmp-5.0.2
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" \
                --enable-cxx
    make
    make check
    make install 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MPFR

MPFR is a GNU C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with correct rounding.  For it to be built, GMP must
also be built.  MPFR can be downloaded from

    http://www.mpfr.org/

as a distribution tarball ($DOWNLOADS/mpfr-3.0.1.tar.bz2).  For
detailed installation instructions, read the INSTALL file in the
root directory of the source.  Here is a short version:

    cd $SRC
    tar xjf $DOWNLOADS/mpfr-3.0.1.tar.bz2  
    cd mpfr-3.0.1
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" \
                --with-gmp="$PREFIX"
    make
    make check
    make install 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MPC

MPC is a C library for the arithmetic of complex numbers with
arbitrarily high precision and correct rounding of the result.
For it to be built, GMP and MPFR must also be built.  MPC can
be downloaded from

    http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=download

as a distribution tarball ($DOWNLOADS/mpc-0.9.tar.gz).  For
detailed installation instructions, read the INSTALL file in the
root directory of the source.  Here is a short version of the
instructions:

    cd $SRC
    tar xzf $DOWNLOADS/mpc-0.9.tar.gz
    cd mpc-0.9
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" \
                --with-gmp="$PREFIX" \
                --with-mpfr="$PREFIX"
    make
    make check
    make install 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Setting the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH variables

From here on, the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variables
must be set so that the already-built libraries and executables
can be found:

    export PATH="$PREFIX"/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$PREFIX"/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

-------------------------------------------------------------------

GCC

TransLucid requires GNU GCC version 4.7.0 or higher.  This is not
an official release and it needs to be checked out from the SVN
repository or the GIT mirror.  For the instructions below, we
assume the use of SVN.  Detailed instructions for checking out
from SVN can be found at

    http://gcc.gnu.org/svn.html

The latest revision that we have verified for use with TransLucid
is 181339.  The following checkout command

    cd $SRC
    svn checkout -r 181339 svn://gcc.gnu.org/svn/gcc/trunk gcc-svn

will place the source in gcc-svn.  Please note that GCC needs to
be built in a different directory.  Here are the building instructions:

    cd $SRC
    mkdir gcc-build-latest
    cd gcc-build-latest
    `pwd`/../gcc-svn/configure \
          --prefix="$PREFIX" \
          --with-gmp="$PREFIX" \
          --with-mpfr="$PREFIX" \
          --with-mpc="$PREFIX" \
          --disable-multilib \
          --enable-languages=c,c++
    make 
    make install

-------------------------------------------------------------------

ICU

TransLucid requires BOOST to be compiled with ICU, which is a
collection of libraries providing Unicode and Globalization
support for software applications.  ICU can be downloaded from

    http://site.icu-project.org/download

as a distribution tarball ($DOWNLOADS/icu4c-4_8_1-src.tgz).
For detailed installation instructions, read the INSTALL file
in the root directory of the source.  Here is a short version
of the instructions:

    cd $SRC
    tar xzf $DOWNLOADS/icu4c-4_8_1-src.tgz
    cd icu/source
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX"
    make
    make install 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

MPI

TransLucid requires BOOST to be compiled with MPI, which is a
collection of Standard MPI (Message Passing Interface) runtime
programs.  BOOST needs the MPI header files to compile correctly.
MPI can be downloaded from

    http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v1.5/

as a distribution tarball (downloads/openmpi-1.5.4.tar.bz2).
For detailed installation instructions, read the INSTALL file
in the root directory of the source.  Here is a short version
of the instructions:

    cd $SRC
    tar xjf $DOWNLOADS/openmpi-1.5.4.tar.bz2
    cd openmpi-1.5.4
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX"
    make
    make install 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

BOOST

BOOST provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries
and the emphasis is on creating libraries that work well with the
C++ Standard Library.  It can be downloaded from

    http://www.boost.org/

as a distribution tarball ($DOWNLOADS/boost_1_48_0.tar.bz2).
Detailed installation instructions can be found at

    http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_48_0/more/getting_started/index.html

The BOOST distribution must be informed that you wish the MPI code
to be compiled in.  Here is the complete instruction sequence:

    cd $SRC
    tar xjf $DOWNLOADS/boost_1_48_0.tar.bz2 
    cd boost_1_48_0
    echo "using mpi ;" >> tools/build/v2/user-config.jam
    ./bootstrap.sh --with-icu --prefix="$PREFIX"
    ./bjam install

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TransLucid

TransLucid's source code is hosted on sourceforge.net in a git repository.
To get the source:

    cd $SRC
    git clone \
        git://translucid.git.sourceforge.net/gitroot/translucid/translucid \
        translucid-git

This creates a new directory, translucid-git, and clones the
source there.  (Note that if you already downloaded TransLucid
from sourceforge yourself, you would know this first step, as
you did it already!)

To build TransLucid:

    cd $SRC
    cd translucid-git
    ./bootstrap.sh
    ./configure --prefix="$PREFIX" \
                --with-boost="$PREFIX" \
                --disable-static \
                CXXFLAGS=-O1
    make
    make install

The --disable-static flag will make it compile faster.  The -O1
(i.e., "dash capital-O one") flag is needed as there seems to be
a bug in GCC: if TransLucid is compiled using -O2 or -O3, the
generated code crashes on execution.
