We have provided a patch for boost to remove the warnings. It is in the
file src/boost_1_47_0-nowarnings.patch.

To apply the patch:
cd $BOOST_SOURCE_ROOT
patch -p1 < $TRANSLUCID_SOURCE/src/boost_1_47_0-nowarnings.patch

Then recompile and reinstall boost.

Note that this can probably also be applied to the headers after being
installed with no problems.


== Bugs in GCC ==

Currently there is a bug in GCC which causes our code to bomb when compiled
with -O2 or -O3. Compiling with -O1 or -O0 works. It is probably better with
-O1 as it is faster and inlines templates.

This bug appears to be in every version of GCC since 4.7.0.

If someone can help find it, please do so.
