We have provided a patch for boost to remove the warnings. It is in the
file src/boost_1_47_0-nowarnings.patch.

To apply the patch:
cd $BOOST_SOURCE_ROOT
patch -p1 < $TRANSLUCID_SOURCE/src/boost_1_47_0-nowarnings.patch

Then recompile and reinstall boost.

Note that this can probably also be applied to the headers after being
installed with no problems.
