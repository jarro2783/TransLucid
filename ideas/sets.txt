a set is a group of values, all the values must have the same type? no.
a general set will probably have to specify all the values, range can derive?
from set and specifies the set as anything between to limits
you could have some sort of other set which has groups of ranges and single
values

there are four types of sets:
sets as containers
sets of pairs = tuple
sets of context - ranges, validity of definitions
types - a type is a set of possible values
