foo @ [x : #y] = expr;;

#y should be evaluated every time, as should @ [], this makes using {} more
efficient.
should the lhs be constant?
could we come up with a way to determine if something is context independent 
and not need to evaluate it afterwards?

any raw int is, strings probably are except that the current way means they are still evaluated as expressions since quote pairs can occur for any type.

Anything involving an operation may or may not be. Overflow etc.
