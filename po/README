There are currently two sets of translation files, these are in
  src/tltext/po
  src/libs/system/po

If you are a translator for a particular language, then you should modify ll.po
in the above directories, where ll is the code for your particular language.

== New translations ==

If you are starting a new translation then read the remainder of this section.
Otherwise skip ahead to "Existing translations".

To create a new translation file for a language, you can either copy domain.pot
to ll.po, or use msginit, where domain is the translation domain for the
current directory---if you are unsure what this is, there is only one *.pot
file in each po directory. For example, to start a translation for German in
src/tltext/po, you could run:
  msginit -l de -i tltext.pot -o de.po
Then add the text `de' (without quotes) to the file LINGUAS in that directory.

At the top of your new file you will see something like:

# SOME DESCRIPTIVE TITLE.                                                       
# Copyright (C) YEAR Jarryd Beck
# This file is distributed under the same license as the PACKAGE package.
# FIRST AUTHOR <EMAIL@ADDRESS>, YEAR.
#
#, fuzzy
msgid ""
msgstr ""
"Project-Id-Version: tl 0.0.80\n"
"Report-Msgid-Bugs-To: \"jarrydb@cse.unsw.edu.au\"\n"
"POT-Creation-Date: 2012-02-14 09:52+1100\n"
"PO-Revision-Date: YEAR-MO-DA HO:MI+ZONE\n"

"Language: de\n"
"MIME-Version: 1.0\n"
"Content-Type: text/plain; charset=CHARSET\n"
"Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit\n"

You should change the first section to look like:

# TransLucid LANGUAGE message translations
# Copyright (C) YEAR Jarryd Beck                 
# This file is distributed under the same license as the TransLucid package.

adjusting LANGUAGE and YEAR as appropriate.

* Fill in the FIRST AUTHOR field.
* Delete the line #, fuzzy
* Change Language-Team to:
  LANGUAGE <translucid@cse.unsw.edu.au>
  where LANGUAGE is the name of the language.
* Change CHARSET to UTF-8

Finally, when you make a change to the file, adjust the PO-Revision-Date, and
adjust the Last-Translator field if necessary.

== Existing translations ==

If you are adding translations for a language that already has translation
files set up, then here are some guidelines:

A translation looks like:

#. TRANSLATORS: the options description name in the help message
#: src/tltext/main.cpp:143
msgid "tltext options"
msgstr ""

Most of our strings will have a comment that starts with
#. TRANSLATORS:
at the top, this will be some sort of description of what the string is for.
The original string is in the msgid field, the translated string should be
placed in the msgstr field. 
All strings are C style strings and should be escaped appropriately.

There are a few special cases for strings:

  * Tokens should not be translated. However, they have a string to be
    translated because they need to be quoted appropriately. So the token
    should be inserted verbatim but quoted according to the conventions of the
    language that you are translating for. These are identified by the 
    translator note: token. 
  * Keywords are the same as tokens, they are identified by the note: keyword.
  * Token descriptions should be translated, these are things like "integer
    literal", they are identified with the translator note "token description".
  * The help strings for tltext might need special attention as they are not
    complete sentences. The help string needs to be explained appropriately in
    the translation. They are also mentioned in the translator notes.
