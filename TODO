-2- - -2-
footer for output
add error checking for all parsing
aether and all in tuples
optional parens in pretty printer
make tuple dim_index -> constant and change everywhere that uses it
check for redefinition of symbols in parser
guarantee that the parser takes the longest match for operators
subdimensions
make specials be called sp
fix special symbols and make them come from the same definition in both the 
parser and the special type
check out tuple_refines, it looks wrong - really need better tests for best 
fitting
