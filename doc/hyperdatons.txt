dimensions:

the dimensions arg[0..inf] are reserved for function parameters

the system responds to the "id" dimension for identifiers
the @ [] on the lhs is in the dimension _validguard

CONST uses type and text

identifiers:
constants are CONST
functions are FUN
default int is in DEFAULTINT

constants that are defined:
uchar

constants that need defining:
bool
special
string
intmp

types:
need to remove the magic for type indexes (RTTI?)
things like special should be built by asking the system for a special instead
of just building it
the index of a type could be part of the system, anyone can ask for it, and
then only if an implementation can see the header declaration for the class of
a type can it access the type.

When a constant is registered it must set CONST.
It must also call _unique and set TYPEINDEX.

it is required that some type and dimension indexes be fixed and visible to 
everyone

   types:
      ustring     TYPE_INDEX_USTRING
      intmp       TYPE_INDEX_INTMP
      bool        TYPE_INDEX_BOOL

   dimensions:
      type        DIM_TYPE
      text        DIM_TEXT
      name        DIM_NAME
      id          DIM_ID
