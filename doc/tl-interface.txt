== Constants ==

All the typed value creators for constants are defined in the interpreter
under the identifier CONST.
CONST varies in the dimensions type and text. Varying the type dimension picks
a specific constant builder, varying text changes the resulting value of the
constant. Varying any other dimension might change how the text dimension is
formatted depending on which type it is.

Defined variables:
CONST @ [type : "intmp"]
CONST @ [type : "uchar"]
CONST @ [type : "ustring"]

a string.
