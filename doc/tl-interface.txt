== Parsing ==

Symbols can be added to the parser through the use of a header.

=== Integers ===

Integers are defined as:
[1-9][0-9]* | 0[2-9a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z]*

=== Specials ===

The specials are recognised by adding sp as a prefix to the specials names.

== Constants ==

All the typed value creators for constants are defined in the
interpreter under the identifier CONST.  CONST varies in the
dimensions type and text. Varying the type dimension picks a specific
constant builder, varying text changes the resulting value of the
constant. Varying any other dimension might change how the text
dimension is formatted depending on which type it is.

Defined variables:
intmp
uchar
ustring

== Dimensions ==

To look up a dimension index:

DIMENSION_INDEX for named dimensions, varies in text dimension which
must be a string.  DIMENSION_TYPED_INDEX for typed dimensions, varies
in value dimension.

=== Predefined Dimensions ==

The following dimensions are predefined and have special meaning inside the
interpreter:

  id         DIM_ID        Used to refer to variables inside a hyperdator.
                           A request for X @ k translates to 
			   H @ [id : "X"] @ k.

  name       DIM_NAME      Used for the name of operations. Operations are
                           contained in the variables OP | [name : "opname"]

  text       DIM_TEXT      Used by constant builders to read the text in
                           between the <> in type<value>. Also used by
			   DIMENSION_INDEX to find the indices of dimensions.

  time       DIM_TIME      The current time.

  type       DIM_TYPE      Used to refer to the typed value of something.
                           The type of the dimension is always ustring.
			   Referenced by CONST, TYPEINDEX.

  validguard DIM_VALIDGUARD Used when adding an equation. The guard part of
                           the equation is passed in the dimension validguard.

  value      DIM_VALUE     Used by variables that need a single value passed.
                           DIMENSION_TYPED_INDEX uses value for the type value
			   being used as a dimension.

  argN                     These are created as needed and store the arguments
                           to things like operations.

== Operations ==

Operations are in the identifier OP. OP varies in the name dimension.
The name could be operator+, operator- etc.
These all vary in the argN dimensions.

= Libraries =

== Int library ==

The integer library registers operations on intmp and the following types:
u?int(8|16|32|64).
