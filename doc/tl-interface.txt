== Parsing ==

Symbols can be added to the parser through the use of a header.

=== Integers ===

Integers are defined as:
[1-9][0-9]* | 0[2-9a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z]*

=== Specials ===

The specials are recognised by adding sp as a prefix to the specials names.

== Constants ==

All the typed value creators for constants are defined in the interpreter
under the identifier CONST.
CONST varies in the dimensions type and text. Varying the type dimension picks
a specific constant builder, varying text changes the resulting value of the
constant. Varying any other dimension might change how the text dimension is
formatted depending on which type it is.

Defined variables:
intmp
uchar
ustring

== Dimensions ==

To look up a dimension index:
DIMENSION_INDEX for named dimensions, varies in text dimension which must be
a string.
DIMENSION_TYPED_INDEX for typed dimensions, varies in value dimension.

== Operations ==

Operations are in the identifier OP. OP varies in the name dimension.
The name could be operator+, operator- etc.
These all vary in the argN dimensions.

= Libraries =

== Int library ==

The integer library registers operations on intmp and the following types:
u?int(8|16|32|64).
